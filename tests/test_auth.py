"""
For most of the views, a user needs to be logged in. The easiest way to do this in tests is to make a POST request to the login view with the client. Rather than writing that out every time, you can write a class with methods to do that, and use a fixture to pass it the client for each test.

With the auth fixture, you can call auth.login() in a test to log in as the test user, which was inserted as part of the test data in the app fixture.

"""
1. client.get() / client.post()
    makes a GET request and returns the Response object returned by Flask. Similarly, client.post() makes a POST request, converting the data dict into form data.

    To test that the page renders successfully, a simple request is made and checked for a 200 OK status_code. If rendering failed, Flask would return a 500 Internal Server Error code.

2. headers 
    will have a Location header with the login URL when the register view redirects to the login view.

3. data 
    contains the body of the response as bytes. If you expect a certain value to render on the page, check that itâ€™s in data. Bytes must be compared to bytes. If you want to compare Unicode text, use get_data(as_text=True) instead.

4. pytest.mark.parametrize 
    tells Pytest to run the same test function with different arguments. You use it here to test different invalid input and error messages without writing the same code three times.
